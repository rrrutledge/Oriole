## Introduction (Danese)

## Context (Russ)

### Wait it out (Russ)

### Work around (Russ)

### Escalate (Danese)

* We chose cheeses to designate executives to whom guests escalate then a feature request isn’t being implemented fast enough. In our experience, it’s really common for executive escalations to devolve
* Huge time and resource sink
* Not much is learned in the process of writing the feature / fixing the bug
* Much friction is added to the system

## Solution Overview (Danese)

## Solution Detail - up to 1st paragraph - definitions (Danese)

* Explanation we usually give about how house rules help you know how to behave and what to expect as a guest
* Hosts expect you’ll take your shoes off inside or that you won’t let the cat out, etc.
* Guests expect clean and perhaps private space

## Solution Detail - the rest (Russ)

## Benefits - up to 3rd paragraph - scalability for host team (Danese)

* Key teams that were able to reduce interrupt-driven work by 60%, which gave them back their capacity to plan and execute

## Benefits - the rest (Russ)

* Segue on the scalability point by sharing the story of 5 teams building EC2 deployment at once together.

## Principles (Danese)

* This concept (mentorship) comes straight out of the Apache Way.
Trusted Committers are team members who not only understand the codebase well enough to coach someone else in writing good pull requests to achieve a desired outcome, but they also have the knack of passing on that wisdom in a constructive way.
In Open Source it is an honor to get voted to Trusted Committership.

## Conclusion (Russ)
