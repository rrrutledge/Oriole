The purpose of this document is the hold the supplementary and planning material related to the content of this Oriole

# Goals

This Oriole is also the first in a series of four introducing InnerSource.
These Orioles should be the focal point and shared context of the current public conversation around InnerSource.
In order to acheive that goal, this Oriole must provide:
* Compelling and clear definitions around 5 key terms:
    * Host (team)
    * Guest (team)
    * Trusted Committer
    * Product Owner
    * Contributor
* Guardrails for the minimum viable attributes of InnerSource:
    * Voluntary Code Contribution
    * Prioritized Mentorship
* Interest and anticipation for viewers to watch the remaining Orioles

*Note: Other planning documents for this Oriole had a clear emphasis on staving off misconceptions around InnerSource via calling them out directly.
While reining in misconceptions is an intended result,
the proposal here is to do so by leading with a strong presentation of what is essential to InnerSource.
Anything lacking an essential is not InnerSource.
We may then call out a few prominent misconceptions InnerSource by comparing them to the clear backdrop that we've defined of InnerSource essentials.*

# Audience

The audience for this Oriole is anyone that has heard of InnerSource.

# Outline

## Introduction
Introduce the topic, why it’s important, and what the viewer will learn in this Oriole.

## Justification
Share a hypothetical (yet believable) example situation that illustrates the difficulties today in the off-the-shelf process of collaborating across organizational silos.
This given situation will be the basis to-which we refer throughout the Oriole, most notably when introducing the 5 key terms and heading off misconceptions about InnerSource.

## Solution
Show how the actors in the example can collaborate via InnerSource to overcome the problematic situation.
Explain the benefits of this approach.
While giving this explanation, naturally include clear definitions of the 5 key terms and also wording specifically designed to dispel misconceptions about InnerSource
(before we’ve done those misconceptions the dignity of calling them out directly).

## Further Explanation
Delve into some “gotchas” and more nuanced points about the InnerSource process.
Consider strategic use of short and compelling anecdotes to cement key parts of the message further.
Trend towards including material in this section that further dispels InnerSource misconceptions and also sets the stage for the upcoming Orioles.

## Conclusion
Review they key points of this Oriole and tee up viewers to look for the next Orioles.
